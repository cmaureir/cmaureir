# Hello, my name is Cristián :wave:

I'm currently working at [The Qt Company](https://qt.io) as a Team Lead for the
[QML](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qmlapplications.html),
[QtCore](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtcore-index.html), and [Qt for
Python](https://www.qt.io/qt-for-python) projects, luckily for me, I'm still
actively helping in the [development of the Qt for Python](https://pyside.org)
project, you can check my contributions
[here](https://codereview.qt-project.org/q/owner:cristian.maureira-fredes%2540qt.io+project:pyside/pyside-setup).

On my spare time, I love to participate in local community events :tada: and
activities related to Open Source, Python :snake:, and C++ around the Berlin
area, Check the [Python Users Berlin
Group](https://www.meetup.com/Python-Users-Berlin-PUB), from which I'm
a co-organizer.

Here you will also find some stuff related to my doctoral studies
:mortar_board:, like one of my main achievements,
[GraviDy](https://github.com/cmaureir/gravidy)!  which is an *N-*body system
integrator :star: using different CPU and GPU parallelism techniques, and
[helper scripts](https://github.com/cmaureir/gadget-snapshot-reader) that were
used for this really cool [Black Hole Binaries in accretion
discs](http://multipleclouds.xyz/movies/) simulations :black_circle: :cyclone:.
